Models module for Planetoids

This module contains the model classes for the Planetoids game. Anything that 
you interact with on the screen is model: the ship, the bullets, and the 
planetoids.

We need models for these objects because they contain information beyond the 
simple shapes like GImage and GEllipse. In particular, ALL of these classes 
need a velocity representing their movement direction and speed (and hence they 
all need an additional attribute representing this fact). But for the most part, 
that is all they need. You will only need more complex models if you are adding 
advanced features like scoring.

You are free to add even more models to this module. You may wish to do this 
when you add new features to your game, such as power-ups. If you are unsure 
about whether to make a new class or not, please ask on Ed Discussions.

# PRIMARY RULE: Models are not allowed to access anything in any module other than
# consts.py. If you need extra information from Gameplay, then it should be a 
# parameter in your method, and Wave should pass it as a argument when it calls 
# the method.


class Bullet(GEllipse):
    """
    A class representing a bullet from the ship
    
    Bullets are typically just white circles (ellipses). The size of the bullet 
    is determined by constants in consts.py. However, we MUST subclass GEllipse, 
    because we need to add an extra attribute for the velocity of the bullet.
    
    The class Wave will need to look at this velocity, so you will need getters 
    for the velocity components. However, it is possible to write this assignment 
    with no setters for the velocities. That is because the velocity is fixed 
    and cannot change once the bolt is fired.
    
    In addition to the getters, you need to write the __init__ method to set the 
    starting velocity. This __init__ method will need to call the __init__ from 
    GEllipse as a helper. This init will need a parameter to set the direction 
    of the velocity.
    
    You also want to create a method to update the bolt. You update the bolt by 
    adding the velocity to the position. While it is okay to add a method to 
    detect collisions in this class, you may find it easier to process 
    collisions in wave.py.

    # ADDITIONAL METHODS (MOVEMENT, COLLISIONS, ETC)


class Ship(GImage):
    """
    A class to represent the game ship.
    
    This ship is represented by an image. The size of the ship is determined by 
    constants in consts.py. However, we MUST subclass GEllipse, because we need 
    to add an extra attribute for the velocity of the ship, as well as the facing 
    vector (not the same) thing.
    
    The class Wave will need to access these two values, so you will need getters 
    for them. But per the instructions,these values are changed indirectly by 
    applying thrust or turning the ship. That means you won't want setters for 
    these attributes, but you will want methods to apply thrust or turn the ship.
    
    This class needs an __init__ method to set the position and initial facing 
    angle. This information is provided by the wave JSON file. Ships should 
    start with a shield enabled.
    
    Finally, you want a method to update the ship. When you update the ship, you 
    apply the velocity to the position. While it is okay to add a method to 
    detect collisions in this class, you may find it easier to process collisions 
    in wave.py.

class Asteroid(GImage):
    """
    A class to represent a single asteroid.
    
    Asteroids are typically are represented by images. Asteroids come in three 
    different sizes (SMALL_ASTEROID, MEDIUM_ASTEROID, and LARGE_ASTEROID) that 
    determine the choice of image and asteroid radius. We MUST subclass GImage, 
    because we need extra attributes for both the size and the velocity of the 
    asteroid.
    
    The class Wave will need to look at the size and velocity, so you will need 
    getters for them.  However, it is possible to write this assignment with no 
    setters for either of these. That is because they are fixed and cannot 
    change when the asteroid is created. 
    
    In addition to the getters, you need to write the __init__ method to set the 
    size and starting velocity. Note that the SPEED of an asteroid is defined in 
    const.py, so the only thing that differs is the velocity direction.
    
    You also want to create a method to update the asteroid. You update the 
    asteroid by adding the velocity to the position. While it is okay to add a 
    method to detect collisions in this class, you may find it easier to process 
    collisions in wave.py.
